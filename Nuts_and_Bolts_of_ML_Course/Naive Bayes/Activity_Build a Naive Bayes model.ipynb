    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will build your own Naive Bayes model. Naive Bayes models can be valuable to use any time you are doing work with predictions because they give you a way to account for new information. In today's world, where data is constantly evolving, modeling with Naive Bayes can help you adapt quickly and make more accurate predictions about what could occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you work for a firm that provides insights for management and coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The league is interested in retaining players who can last in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time. In the previous activity, you analyzed a subset of data that contained information about the NBA players and their performance records. You conducted feature engineering to determine which features would most effectively predict a player's career duration. You will now use those insights to build a model that predicts whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this activity consists of performance statistics from each player's rookie year. There are 1,341 observations, and each observation in the data represents a different player in the NBA. Your target variable is a Boolean value that indicates whether a given player will last in the league for five years. Since you previously performed feature engineering on this data, it is now ready for modeling.   "
